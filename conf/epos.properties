### Dataset ###
#The folder name in the datasets path. Make sure it has no spaces, tabs or newlines (alphanum and underscore preferred)
dataset=gaussian


### Basic epos properties ###
# any integer > 0
numSimulations=5

# any integer > 0
numIterations=40

# any integer > 0
numAgents=100

# any integer > 0
numPlans=10

# any integer > 0
numChildren=2

# exact dimensionality from the dataset
planDim=100


### Shuffle seeds ###

# initial agent structure before reorganization occurs, any integer > 0
shuffle=0

# path to a file containing permutation of indices, need its strucure: sphinx one column: integer index in each row
shuffle_file="permutation.csv" 


### Multi-objective Cost Weights ###
# Number of supported objectives: 3
# Efficiency objective: 1-alpha-beta
# Fairness objective: alpha
# Discomfort objective: beta
# (1-alpha-beta)*inefficiency + alpha*unfairness + beta*discomfort
# "alpha,beta", e.g. "0.3,0.7" for alpha=0.3 and beta=0.7
# this needs to be removed actually
numberOfWeights = 2 
# Weights are in string format, separated by ","  
weightsString = "0.0,0.0"


### Reorganization strategy ###

# possible values: periodically, convergence, globalCostReduction, never. never_strategy: never does reorganization
strategy=never

# any integer > 0, if "periodically" strategy is chosen
periodically.reorganizationPeriod=3

# any positive integer (>0), if "convergence" strategy is chosen, the iteration at which the selections will be memorized to be sued after the following reorganization
convergence.memorizationOffset=5

# double from [0, 1]
globalCost.reductionThreshold=0.5

# any integer. Keep the same seed to reproduce experiment results, what random permutations each strategy will explore, result reproducability
strategy.reorganizationSeed=0
